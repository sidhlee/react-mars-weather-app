# Adding Responsive Design

_PreviousWeather component is not included._

## Memo

### Spacing in Grid

- Use padding to add space between grid-items.
- It's easier to control elements and reason about it.

### Adding media queries in styled-components

- It's actually easier to add media queries to individual component.
  - Styles in different break-points are placed in one place
  - Easier to compare and edit.
  - Less mistakes (repeating, omitting,...)
